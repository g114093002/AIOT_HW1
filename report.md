# ✨ Project Report: Simple Linear Regression Visualizer ✨

> A comprehensive summary of the development process for the interactive linear regression web application.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Project Initialization and Planning

Our journey began by establishing a foundation for the project.

1.  **Setting Up a Log:** To ensure transparency and maintain a record of all actions, a `log.md` file was created.

2.  **Understanding the Vision:** The project's core requirements were sourced from `ref/idea.md`. The goal was to build an interactive web app to explore **simple linear regression**, guided by the **CRISP-DM framework**.

3.  **Creating a Roadmap:** A detailed, step-by-step plan was meticulously crafted and stored in `step.md`. This document served as our guiding star throughout the development process.

## 💻 Phase 2: Application Development

With a clear plan, we moved on to building the application itself.

1.  **`README.md`:** A user-friendly `README.md` was written to explain the *what* and *why* of the project.

2.  **`requirements.txt`:** The project's dependencies were explicitly listed in `requirements.txt` to ensure a reproducible environment.
    ```
    streamlit
    scikit-learn
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    ```

3.  **`app.py`:** The heart of the project, `app.py`, was developed. This Python script powers the entire **Streamlit** web application and includes:
    *   **Interactive UI:** Sidebar controls for tuning the `slope`, `noise`, and `number of points`.
    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** A function that creates datasets on-the-fly based on user input.
    *   **Machine Learning Model:** Integration of `scikit-learn`'s `LinearRegression` to fit a model to the data.
    *   **Rich Visualization:** A `matplotlib` plot that dynamically updates to show the data and the corresponding regression line.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Execution and Troubleshooting

The final phase focused on bringing the application to life and ensuring it ran smoothly.

1.  **Dependency Installation:** All required libraries were installed using `pip`.

2.  **First Launch:** The application was initially started with `streamlit run app.py`.

3.  **Problem Solving:** An issue was identified where the app was inaccessible. Through foreground execution, we diagnosed that the application was stuck on an **interactive prompt** from Streamlit.

4.  **The Fix:** The issue was resolved by relaunching the app in **headless mode** (`--server.headless true`), which successfully bypassed the prompt and started the server.

## ✅ Final Status

The **Simple Linear Regression Visualizer** is now **live and running!**

> You can access the application at: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

The entire process has been documented for future reference.
