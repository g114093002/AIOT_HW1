# Steps for Simple Linear Regression Project

Here is a step-by-step plan to complete the assignment based on the requirements in `idea.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and CRISP-DM Framework

### Step 1: Business Understanding
- **Objective:** Create a web application to visualize and understand simple linear regression.
- **Success Criteria:** A deployed web application where users can interact with the parameters of a linear dataset and see the regression line.

### Step 2: Data Understanding
- We will not use a pre-existing dataset. Instead, we will generate data based on user inputs.
- The data will be 2D points that follow a linear pattern `y = ax + b` with added noise.

### Step 3: Data Preparation
- **Data Generation:** Create a Python function to generate a set of points (x, y).
- **Inputs:** The function will take the following parameters from the user:
    - `a`: The slope of the line.
    - `noise`: The amount of random noise to add to the y-values.
    - `num_points`: The number of data points to generate.
- The 'b' intercept can be fixed or also made a user-tunable parameter.

## Phase 2: Modeling and Implementation

### Step 4: Modeling
- **Algorithm:** Implement a simple linear regression model using a library like `scikit-learn`.
- **Process:**
    1.  Take the generated data (x, y points).
    2.  Create a `LinearRegression` model instance.
    3.  Fit the model to the data to find the best-fit line.

### Step 5: Evaluation
- **Visualization:** The primary evaluation will be visual. Plot the generated data points and the calculated regression line on the same graph.
- **Metrics (Optional):** We can also calculate and display metrics like R-squared or Mean Squared Error (MSE) to show how well the line fits the data.

## Phase 3: Deployment and User Interface

### Step 6: Deployment
- **Framework:** Choose between Streamlit or Flask for the web application framework. Streamlit is generally faster for data-focused apps.
- **Application Structure:**
    - `app.py`: The main Python script for the web app.
    - `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python libraries (e.g., `streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).

### Step 7: User Interface (UI)
- **Controls:** Create UI elements (sliders or input boxes) for the user to modify:
    - Slope `a`
    - Noise level
    - Number of points
- **Output:**
    - Display the plot with the data and regression line.
    - Show the equation of the fitted line (e.g., `y = 2.1x + 0.9`).
    - (Optional) Display the evaluation metrics.

## Phase 4: Finalization

### Step 8: Final Submission
- **Code:** Push the final code to a GitHub repository.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud service (like Streamlit Cloud).
- **Documentation:** Ensure the `README.md` in the GitHub repository explains the project and how to run it.
