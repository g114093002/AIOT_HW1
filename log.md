# Gemini Log

- I will log what you teach me in `log.md`.
- You will put reference material in the `ref` directory.
- I have read `idea.md` and created `step.md` with a detailed plan.
- I have created the complete project structure including `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and `app.py`.
- I have installed the dependencies and started the Streamlit application.
- I have created a final report of our actions in `report.md`.
- I have corrected the formatting of `report.md` to ensure it is valid Markdown.
- I have beautified the `report.md` file with enhanced Markdown formatting.
- I have prepared the project for GitHub, set the correct remote URL, and successfully pushed the project to the repository.
- I have expanded and beautified the `README.md` file with more detailed content.
