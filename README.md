# Simple Linear Regression Visualizer

## Objective
This project is a web application designed to help users visualize and understand simple linear regression.

## How it Works
The application generates a dataset based on the linear equation `y = ax + b`. Users can adjust the following parameters:
- The slope `a` of the line
- The amount of `noise` in the data
- The `number of points` in the dataset

The app then fits a simple linear regression model to the generated data and displays:
- A scatter plot of the data points.
- The calculated regression line overlaid on the plot.
